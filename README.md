## Simple Linear Regression

This project was to get a better understanding of data manipulation in Pandas. As I am pulling multiple data from a variety of sources (Yahoo Fiance and RBA Finance Data).

Problems i had were that import XLS does not recognise numbers as floats or integers which created problems in extracting the data into a data frame. 

Due to this i used a large quantity of .iloc to manipulate the data into a data frame. 

For this project i was looking at a simple CAPM linear model to understand how CBA bank moves compared to the ASX200 (Market index proxie), Risk free is AU gov bond 10yr bond.
